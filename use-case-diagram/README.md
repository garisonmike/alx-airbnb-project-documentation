Airbnb Clone Backend – Use Case Diagram



This directory contains the use case diagram for the Airbnb Clone backend project. The diagram provides a visual overview of how users and system components interact with key features.



Overview



The diagram illustrates the main actors (Guests, Hosts, Admin) and their interactions with the system. It focuses on core processes such as:



User registration and authentication



Property management



Booking reservations



Payment processing



Notifications and reviews



By mapping out these interactions early, we ensure that the backend logic aligns with real-world usage scenarios.



Key Actors



Guest – Searches for properties, makes bookings, leaves reviews, and manages payments.



Host – Creates and manages property listings, handles bookings, and receives payouts.



Admin – Oversees the platform, manages users, listings, and payments.



Purpose



This diagram acts as a bridge between high-level feature planning and detailed system design. It helps the development team understand user flows and system touchpoints before moving to user stories and database design.
