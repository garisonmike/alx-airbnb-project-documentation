\# Airbnb Clone Backend – User Stories



This directory contains the user stories derived from the Use Case Diagram of the Airbnb Clone backend. Each story captures a key interaction between a user (guest, host, or admin) and the system, providing developers with guidance on what to build and why.



\## What’s Inside

\- \*\*`user-stories.md`\*\*: A collection of user-focused scenarios covering registration, property management, search, booking, payments, reviews, and notifications.



\### Why This Matters

User stories help shift the development focus from “what the system does” to “what the user needs.” They’re short, goal-oriented, and written from the user’s perspective—making them ideal for guiding backend architecture and functionality.
